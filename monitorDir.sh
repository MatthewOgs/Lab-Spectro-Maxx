# Ver: 1
# This script is intended to monitor a directory set by MONITORDIR. 
# It also waits for a network file to be mounted before starting
# The monitoring is done using inotify-tools API
# Please install the inotify tools using, 'sudo apt-get install inotify-tools'
# The script will not work without it.
# To run the script at startup add bash '/home/pi/Scripts/monitorDir.sh &' to rc.local
# The '&' allows for the script not to halt the boot process
# This script monitors a directory that rsync's with the mounted directory and
# thus waits for the directory to be mounted first
